 * The indent level for JSON logs.
 *
 * By default Logger will use the `LogJsonIndent.COMPACT` indent level, which
 * produces logs on a single line. This is the most efficient option for
 * CloudWatch Logs.
 *
 * When enabling the `POWERTOOLS_DEV` environment variable, Logger will use the
 * `LogJsonIndent.PRETTY` indent level, which indents the JSON logs for easier
 * reading.
